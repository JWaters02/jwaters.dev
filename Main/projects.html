                        <p>
                            Simply put, <a class="link" href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank">Advent of Code</a> is a set of 25 puzzles that release for the 25 days of Christmas in December every year. Puzzles increase in difficulty slowly as the month progresses, with Day 25 usually being an incredibly difficult problem. Every day, the puzzle is split into two parts, where the second part always builds on top of the program you made for the first part.
                            <br>

                            Every year there is a story that progresses as each day passes, usually something to do with saving Christmas!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You can do the puzzles in whichever language you please, so in 2019 I got up to Day 13 with C#, and in 2020 I used Python. A friend of mine did <a class="link" href="https://github.com/CodedSakura/AoC2020" target="_blank">each day in a different language</a> in AoC 2020!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Every player can make a private leaderboard, or join some if they have the codes. In 2020, I was in 7 leaderboards. Points are worked out based on your rank of finishing the puzzle, where the first person gets N points (where N is the number of users on leaderboard), second gets N-1 points etc until the final gets 1. This encourages competitiveness although unfortunately it unlocks at 5am UTC (midnight where the creator lives). The good side is that by Day 10, the puzzles reach a difficulty where many people cannot finish them and so it comes about skill rather than speed (although in 2020 all the puzzles were quite easy until Day 15).

                        <p>
                            The Advent of Code 2019 event was based around saving Christmas in the Solar System. The first day story context setting reads:
                            <blockquote>
                                "Santa has become stranded at the edge of the Solar System while delivering presents to other planets! To accurately calculate his position in space, safely align his warp drive, and return to Earth in time to save Christmas, he needs you to bring him measurements from fifty stars.

                                Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
                                
                                The Elves quickly load you into a spacecraft and prepare to launch."
                            </blockquote>
                            This sets the scene of the event quite nicely, as the story is of course very important throughout the event.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The 2019 puzzles were quite a lot more difficult than previous years, and also than 2020. Just compare these stats from both years, how few people have completed the later puzzles (even if number of solvers was taken into account, this is still a lot lower).
                            <br>

                            This event happened when I was at school, in Year 13. I completed challenges up to Day 13, although skipped Day 9, 11 and 12. I did the challenges using C#. I struggled with these puzzles somewhat because I was not really a very experienced programmer, and starting on Day 2, there was a program that subsequent odd numbered day puzzles built upon. This was called the Intcode Computer, essentially an assembly program built based on sets of rules given each puzzle. I managed to the first challenges on this using hack fixes, but eventually the rules became too complicated for me and I gave up. Maybe I will go back to them at some point.

                        <p>
                            Advent of Code 2020 was a bit different, story-wise, than the other events, because it was all about getting Santa to his vacation island for a nice break from constantly saving Christmas! Although he does do some super criminal things along the way... *cough* hacking airport security, stealing passports, getting on plane without bording pass *cough*. Here's the first day story context setting:
                            <blockquote>
                                After saving Christmas five years in a row, you've decided to take a vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go on without you.
                                The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The gold coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just call them stars. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them, but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.
                                To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th. 
                                Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
                            </blockquote>
                            Many funny moments were had in this story!

                            <br>
                            This time around, I completed puzzles in Python, a language that is much easier to code these quick and short scripts in, than any typed languages. This is were the Pythonic nature really shines. You can find my Github repository for this event <a class="link" href="https://github.com/JWaters02/AoC-2020" target="_blank">here.</a> I found these puzzles a lot easier than last year, and stayed awake/woke up for 5am every day to compete with my American (and some British!) friends on my leaderboards. This has allowed me to gain some really good global ranks on most days:
